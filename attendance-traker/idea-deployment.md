project title : student check-in system ( SCIS )
Objective:  The main purpose of this project is for every student present in a class to be able to sign attedance at ease. with each  data record be forwarded to the lecturers file of records. 
Problem to solve: to ease the stress in signing of attendance. 
Approach in solving this problem: 
a user is created when he/she signs up 
the users matric number is collected as a passcode to access the website  
once the user is in the website, on the superuser admin panel a code is generated when the admin is ready to begin the  marking of attendance of students. For a student to be able to mark attendance, the code which was generated at that particular day and time range, must be filled in,  in order to mark your presense for that leture. The time frame for the validity of the generated code is determined by the admin. the generated code can be terminated when ever time it suites the admin.
once the admin is done with the registration, or the time frame for the validity of the code has elapsed, the data is saved and recorded. now, the admin has the total number of student that was present for that course on that day.
